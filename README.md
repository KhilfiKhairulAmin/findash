### Problem Definition

Create a financial management application. It can:

- track accounts (i.e. Wallet, Bank Accounts, E-Wallet, etc.) and their respective balance
- create, edit, store and track spendings and their respective metadata such as type, description, receipt photo, and other related properties
- create budget based on a set time range (i.e. weekly, monthly, daily, etc.)
- create, store, and track stores, and their items prices (i.e. MyDin (Store), Oil Cap Buruh (Item sold at MyDin))
- use data science concepts to evaluate financial needs and performance
- show graph of spendings, and other relevant graphs or visuals to help understanding of financial performance
- integrate AI chatbot to suggest financial advice based on current performance/budget


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
